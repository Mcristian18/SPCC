## Overview
  - The title of the challenge is Stats preview card component and it is a great start for beginners to make this webpage. As a beginner, I saw different concepts and elements I used, including positioning, CSS box model and media query. Building the structure and style will test the challenger's skills if he/she can accomplish this task and replicate the webpage as close as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

  - Proceed with this link, you will see the desktop and mobile view.

## My process
  - As I introduced to media query, I learned that it's important to create a website that is responsive because we developers want to make it a great user experience. In addition, I also learned the importance of positioning because that is one of the major factors once the website runs on different pixels of width. 

### Built with
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

@media only screen and (min-width: 1000px) {

  h2{
    font-size: 1.45rem;
  }

  .main-container {
    width: 50%;
    height: 300px;
    position: relative;
    top: 160px;
    border-top-right-radius: 2%;
  }

  - This code is essential because in this day and age, most websites run on different devices. 

### Continued development

  - As I learned html and css, I reflected on some concepts I know and compared them to this challenge. I realized that some concepts I knew were actually wrong. With this challenge, I learned the importance of positioning and CSS box model as well as media query. Most element I used in this challenge were taught by my professor

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website guides me so much, especially when there's something I forget. I will immediately search for some html and css elements to recall what's they're function.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/) - Same goes with this one. It also shows some examples to understand and see what the elements do in a program.
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYV6dYtz4HA) - This is absolutely a bomb because I understand so much compared to school and other online courses. It helped me to use media queries in order to run my program on various devices.
